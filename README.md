# CSharp-ConsoleHangMan
I created this C# console program to play a simple game of hangman. The computer selects a random word from a defined array of possible words using the random function. A for loop is used to hide each unguessed letter with an asterisk to allow the user to see how many letters they have left to guess. If the users inputted letter matches any in the mystery word, they will be revealed. A try-catch statement has been used to prevent the user from entering multiple characters during a guess. I wanted to test the StringBuilder function and therefore used this when comparing the guesses string against the mystery word to congratulate the user on guessing it correctly.
